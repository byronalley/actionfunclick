This game was created as part of a challenge to develop the most boring
possible game.

Making a boring game is subtly trickier than just making a bad game. A bad game
can be ugly or frustrating or cheesy without actually being boring.

That's what this game attempts to achieve.

Created in HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
